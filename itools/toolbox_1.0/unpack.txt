                 This manual defines and describes the use of the
             ISIS-II Software Toolbox.  The Toolbox is a collection of
             utilities which enhance the ISIS-II operating system to
             improve programmer productivity.  

                 The manual is organized as follows:


             QUICK REFERENCE SUMMARY

                 The following section contains a "quick reference"
             summary of what each tool does.


             EXPLANATION OF SOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

                 An explanation of the philosophy behind the Source
             Management System, and a description of how the Source
             Management tools work together, is given in Source
             Management Overview chapter.  The appropriate tools are
             described immediately after the overview.


             OVERVIEW OF CONDITIONAL SUBMIT CONTROL

                 A brief description of conditional Submit execution,
             plus an example using most of the tools, is contained in
             the Submit File Control Overview.  The individual Submit
             tools follow the overview.


             OTHER TOOLS

                 Those tools not associated with Submit Control or
             Source Management are listed alphabeticallly, following
             those two sections.




                                 IDENTIFYING THE TOOLS

                 The version numbers of the programs constituting the
             Software Toolbox can be ascertained through the Software
             Toolbox tool, "Which".

                 The central feature of the Source Management System is
             that all source modules have a wholly numeric filename
             extension consisting of exactly three ascii decimal digits;
             e.g., "003", "057", "671", etc.  

                 The utilities which comprise the Source Management
             System interpret these numeric extensions as being version
             numbers.  A numerically greater version number is deemed to
             indicate a more recent version of a given file.

                 The Source Management System can mark object modules
             with the version  number of the source file from which it
             was generated.  The 8080 and 8086 linkers and locators pass
             this information all the way through to the load module,
             allowing the Chklod program to display and process it.




             The utilities comprising the Source Management System are: 


             XLATE2 -- like submit except that it can pick up the
                       "latest" version of a given filename, and
                       substitute it into the Command Sequence File it
                       is building
   
             MRKOBJ -- "marks" object modules with the name of the source
                       file from which they were produced. Mrkobj works
                       on both 8080 and 8086 object modules.  

             CHKLOD -- examines load modules; finds, processes, and
                       displays the source version information
                       previously placed there by Mrkobj

             CLEAN  -- gets rid of all the old versions of all the files
                       on a specified disk

             LATEST -- displays latest version numbers of specified files

             SUMMARY


                 Xlate2 is a part of the source-management family of
             tools.  It is much like the Submit cusp, but has
             "intelligent parameter substitution" capability.

                 It can determine the greatest numeric extension of a
             particular file on a particular disk, and substitute the
             filename plus extension into the Command Sequence file.

                 This program WILL work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard
             Disks.

                 After the command sequence file has been executed,
             control will return to the caller, via the the final
             "xlate2 RESTORE" command.

                 Xlate2 has fairly different parameter substitution than
             Submit in that it only passes file names, yet has the
             capability to retrieve the latest version of a particular
             file.  The best of both worlds may be realized by including
             Xlate2 commands within Submit files, and utilizing the
             extended parameter passing capability of Submit.



                            FORMAL SYNTACTIC SPECIFICATION

             The invocation syntax for XLATE2 is :

             XLATE2 [?] [HALT!] <filename> <digit> <filename_list>

             <filename> is the name of a template file, the function of
                      which is described later.

             <digit> is a decimal digit from 0 to 9 , giving the
                      device_number from which numeric filename
                      extensions should be taken. Only one such device
                      is allowed per invocation of xlate2.

             <filename_list> is a list of isis-II filenames separated by
                      blanks, (NOT commas). Additionally, filenames of
                      the form namepart dot (no extension, but a dot)
                      are allowed and have an interpretation given
                      below. Note that the device can be respecified but
                      this will be ignored.  Continuation is allowable
                      by the use of & as the last non-blank character on
                      a line. ** , the standard prompt, will be issued
                      after continued lines.

             ?        causes xlate2 to print its version number and exit.

             HALT!    causes the consol file to be created but not
                      executed, allowing verification. The consol file
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 6


                      created will be xlate2.cs on the drive from which
                      xlate2 was invoked.


             The template file uses the following substitution:

             substitution signs: substitutions are of the form %0 or #0.

             the substitution matrix: don't get confused here, all you
                      probably want is %0.ext and #0 in the template and
                      a <filename_list> with name parts only (no dot,   
                      no extension) on the command line.


                               foo          foo.          foo.abc
                         +-------------------------------------------+

              %0         |     foo          foo.          foo.abc    |
                         |                                           |

                         +-------------------------------------------+
                         

             foo.#xt is the greatest numeric extension of foo found in
                      isis.dir on the device_number.  If no numeric
                      extension of foo is found then a warning will be
                      issued and foo. will appear in place of foo.#xt in
                      the consol file.

             In the above example it is assumed that ext is <= 3
                      characters. If not then a warning will be given.

             Note: In all the template substitutions it is wise to
             ----     follow them with a blank.


             Note: additionally :fn:<subtitution_parameter> will
             ----     preserve the n in the template substitution, at
                      least for 0 <= n <= 9. Furthermore for :f?: , the
                      <device_number> will be substituted for the ?.

             Note:   Warnings will be printed to both the cold-boot
             ----     console and to the current console if different.

             SUMMARY
                                              
                 This program is a member of the PL/M Source Management
             Family.  It "marks" object modules with the name of the
             source file from which it was produced. Mrkobj works on
             both 8080 and 8086 object modules.  

                 The program name "mrkobj" is intended to be a mnemonic
             for "mark object module".

                 The version number information within the "marked"
             object module will be used later, by the Chklod program,
             which will perform source program version determination and
             checking.

                 This program WILL work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard
             Disks.
    

             SAMPLE PROGRAM INVOCATION

                       MRKOBJ  :f1:main.obj  WITH  :f1:main.003
                                        

             SAMPLE ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 The object module ":f1:main.obj" will be marked with
             the source file name ":f1:main.003".


             TYPICAL USE ENVIRONMENT

                 Mrkobj is intended to be used in conjunction with the
             xlate2 tool, since xlate2 can automatically determine the
             latest version of the source file, avoiding errors that
             could occur with manual invocations of Mrkobj.

                 A sample "xlate2-type" submit file which uses Mrkobj
             is:

             ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 The object modules are marked by the insertion of extra
             records.  


             RECORDS USED

                 For the 8086, a comment record is used.  For the 8080,
             a debug record is used.  Both types of records are
             purgable.

                                

                                   ERROR CONDITIONS

             TARGET OBJECT MODULE IS LIBRARY


                 If the object module is a library, then Mrkobj will
             print:

                   *** <object_module_name> IS AN 8080 LIBRARY ***

             TARGET OBJECT MODULE IS SEQUENCE
             
                 If the object module specified is a sequence, then

             SUMMARY
                                           
                 Chklod is a member of the PL/M Source Management
             Family.  It examines 8080 or 8086 loadable object modules
             for source file version number information.  The version
             numbers were previously placed in the object modules (by
             the Mrkobj Software Toolbox program) befor being linked.

                 Using the version information, and examining a program
             source disk directory or directories, Chklod ascertains
             whether the source files used to produce the load module,
             are the most "recent" source modules.

                 Chklod can also produce a "listing" of a specified load
             module.  The listing is a formatted, human-readable
             compendium of the source version information found in the
             load module.

                 This program WILL work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard
             Disks.

                 If Chklod finds that the source version information,
             for a single source file, has been specified more than once
             in a single load module, then the message:
             
             "WARNING:  respecification of source version 
                             information encountered"
              SOURCE PROGRAM NAME: <name_part_of_source_program_1>"
              LOAD MODULE VERSION LEVELS:  
                  <three_digit_ascii_numeric_extension_1>
                  <three_digit_ascii_numeric_extension_2>
                                    .
                                    .
                                    .
                      etc.    

                 will be output to the console output device.  In these
             cases, Chklod will choose the source file with the highest
             numeric extension as being correct,  in performing its
             subsequent checking.


             EXPLICIT DEVICE SPECIFICATION CAUSES A PAUSE AND PROMPT

                 When the disk drives to be searched for source files
             are explicitly specified in Chklod's command tail, then,
             before reading the specified disk directory, Chklod will
             halt and write:

             "insert source disk in drive n and type <cr> to continue --"

                 to the console output, and then wait until <CRLF> is
             typed.


             SOURCE VERSION DISCREPANCIES

                 For source filenames where the greatest numeric
             extension gleaned from disk is different than the numeric
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 11


             extension found in the load module, the the message(s):


             VERSION DISCREPANCY FOUND
             
             SOURCENAME: <source_file_name_part_1>
             LOAD MODULE VERSION LEVEL:  nnn
             SOURCE MODULE VERSION LEVEL:  nnn
             
             SOURCENAME: <source_file_name_part_2>
             LOAD MODULE VERSION LEVEL:  nnn
             SOURCE MODULE VERSION LEVEL:  nnn

                                           .
                                    etc.
             
                 will be written to the console output.  (nnn is a three-
             digit numeric extension.)

                 If there is more than one numeric extension entry in
             either the directory or the load module, then the above
             error message(s) refer to the largest ones found.


             EXPECTED SOURCE MODULE NOT FOUND

                 If there is no file in the source disk(s) which
             corresponds with a numeric extension record in the load
             module, then the form of discrepancy listing is:


             SOURCENAME: <source_file_name_part>
             LOAD MODULE VERSION LEVEL:  nnn
             SOURCE MODULE VERSION LEVEL:  (NONE)


                 If the greatest numeric extension gleaned from disk is
             equal to the numeric extension found in the load module,
             then no discrepancy message is produced.

                 If Chklod finds no discrepancies of any kind, including
             doubly marked load modules, then the message:

                                NO DISCREPANCIES FOUND

                 will be output to the system console.


             INVALID LOAD MODULE

                 If the object module is a library then Chklod will
             print 

                         "SPECIFIED LOAD MODULE IS A LIBRARY" 

                 to the console output, and exit.

                            LOAD MODULE LISTING PRODUCTION

                 The keyword "LISTING", or its abbreviation "LT",
             appearing in the command tail causes Chklod to produce a
             formatted listing of the source program version level
             information found in the specified load module.  If no
             output device is specified, then the listing goes to the
             console output device.  

                 The listing will be sorted, unless the NOSORT option is
             specified.

             SUMMARY

                 Clean, is one of the Source Management Tools.  It gets
             rid of all the "old" versions of a file on the specified
             disk.  An old file is one with the same name part as
             another file, but with a lesser numeric extension.

                 This program WILL work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard
             Disks.

             ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 The single decimal digit specifies which device Clean
             is to operate upon. Clean reads in the directory, and
             determines which files with numeric extensions are not the
             most recent versions of that file.  Clean then deletes all
             the old versions of the file.  Clean also deletes all files
             with extensions "tmp", and "bak".



             EXAMPLE

                If the files
            
                    main.003,main.004,main.005

                    token.bak
            
                appear on the same drive, the Clean will delete files

             SUMMARY

                 Latest is a tool which, given a list of filenames,
             lists the greatest numeric extension for each.

                 Latest is one of the family of source management tools.

                 This program WILL work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard 
             Disks.


             SAMPLE INVOCATION WITH OUTPUT

             Given the command:

                        :f1:latest 5 main filnam &
                                          prog &

             and assuming that
             
                 :f5:main has numeric extensions 001 002 and 006
                 :f5:filnam has numeric extension 000

                              <question_mark>

             <decimal_digit> is a decimal digit from 0 to 9,
                 giving the device_number from which numeric filename
                 extensions should be taken. Only one such device is
                 allowed per invocation of latest.

             <filename_list> is a list of isis-II filenames
                 separated by blanks, (NOT commas). Additionally,
                 filenames of the form namepart dot (no extension, but

                 just a dot) are allowed and have an interpretation
                 given below. Note that the device can be respecified
                 but the respecification will be ignored. Continuation
                 is allowable by the use of an ampersand as the last
                 non-blank character on a line. Two asterisks, the
                 standard continuation line prompt, will be issued
                 before continued lines.

             ?      Causes LATEST to print its version number and exit.




             WARNINGS AND ERRORS

                 Warnings will be printed to both the cold boot console
             and to the current system console, if different.

                 Structured programming has finally arrived for the
             submit file  user.  It is now possible to structure your
             command files to make  them more readable, more managable,
             and more meaningful.  The  package of commands will allow
             you to make decisions and branches  within a command file. 

                 The "IF" family of tools contains a series of
             commands which work together to provide this total
             capability: IF, ELSE, ENDIF, GOTO, LOOP, RETURN, RESCAN,
             EXIT, WAIT and NOTE. 

                 As an example, the following Submit file will compile a
             program,  and if there are no errors, link and locate the
             object. 

                IF NOT PLM80 THEN 
                    WAIT; Put the PLM80 disk in drive 0 
                    LOOP; 
                ENDIF; 
                ;; RECOMP 
                PLM80 %0.PLM NOLIST 
                IF ' 0 PROGRAM ERROR' IN %0.LST THEN 
                    LINK %0.OBJ,SYSTEM.LIB,PLM80.LIB TO %0.LNK 
                    LOCATE %0.LNK MAP PURGE 
                ELSE 
                    EDIT %0.PLM 
                    NOTE; Enter a '1' if you want to recompile %0.PLM 
                    IF '1' = :VI: THEN 
                        GOTO RECOMP; 
                    ENDIF; 
                ENDIF; 
     
                 Line 1 of the example is a test to see if the file
             PLM80 exists  on the disk on drive 0, if it does not, then
             the WAIT command  will be executed, and wait for the user
             to enter a carriage-return at the console.  Then the file-
             existence test is repeated until the file "PLM80" is
             detected on drive 0.

                 Line 5 is a comment line, but it is of the format (two
             consecutive leading semicolons) that the GOTO command uses
             for declaring labels.  Next comes the compile itself.  Line
             7 is to check if the compilation has errors by looking for
             the string ' 0 PROGRAM ERROR' in the program listing.  If
             the string is in the listing, then no errors were detected
             and it is OK to link and locate.  (The 'THEN' after the
             condition is treated as a comment.) If the condition is not
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 17


             met, the editor is invoked, and the user can edit the
             source and recompile.  

                 Finally, the NOTE command tells the user what (s)he can
             do to cause the modified source program to be recompiled. 
             The next IF command allows the user to interactively
             control the flow of the commands. 

                 This example illustrates almost all the features of the
             IF family of tools.  The individual commands are explained
             in the following sections.

             SUMMARY

                 The IF command is the most powerful command of the
             package.  It ascertains the conditions that are most likely
             used: string comparison, file comparison, string in file,
             and file existance.  There are six types of assertions. 

                 The syntax of the IF command is: 

                      IF [NOT] <string> = <string>  [comment] 
                      IF [NOT] <string> = <file>    [comment] 
                      IF [NOT] <string> IN <string> [comment] 
                      IF [NOT] <string> IN <file>   [comment] 
                      IF [NOT] <file> = <file>      [comment] 
                      IF [NOT] <file>               [comment] 


             1.  STRING COMPARISON

                 The first form, string comparison, allows conditional
             Submit file execution based on submit parameters.  One
             compares a fixed string with a string defined by a submit
             parameter.  An example: 

                 ;copy files from :F3: to :F2:, IDISK first if desired. 
                 IF NOT '%0' = '' THEN 
                   IDISK :F2:NONSYS.DSK 
                 ENDIF; 
                 COPY :F3:*.SRC TO :F2: Q 
                 ^E

                 The two strings being compared are both converted to
             upper-case  first, and the length of the two strings must
             be the same.  Otherwise they are considered unequal. 

                 Note that the command syntax allows optional comments 
             after the conditional expression.  The word 'THEN' is
             treated as a comment by the IF command. 

             2.  STRING = FILE

                 The second form of the IF command is most often used
             for interactive control.  It tests if the given string
             exactly matches the first part of the specified file, the
             remainder of the file, if any, is ignored.  An example: 

                 NOTE; select the compiler to use by typing '1' when desired 
                 IF '1' = :VI: THEN /* PASCAL */ 
                   PASC86 %0 
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 19


                 ELSE IF '1' = :VI: THEN /* PLM86 */ 
                   PLM86 %0
                 ELSE IF '1' = :VI: THEN /* FORTRAN */
                   FORT86 %0
                 ELSE IF '1' = :VI: THEN /* ASM86 */
                   ASM86 %0
                 ELSE
                      NOTE; You didn't select any compile, &
                            type '1' if you want to start over again.
                 IF '1' = :VI: THEN 
                   LOOP    /* Start over again */
                       ENDIF;
                 ENDIF;


             This example also shows how nested IF commands and ELSE IF
             commands (which are explained later) are used.  IF commands
             can be nested to an arbitrary depth. 

                                     *  CAUTION  *

                 Be careful not to use :CI: as the input file, because
             it will cause the next command line to be swallowed.  Note
             that the input file is opened for read.  Therefore when :VI:
             is specified, there is no echoing, and no indication that
             the system is waiting for input is given; so it is best to
             limit the input to a single character,  and to provide a
             note to the user

                 Also, IF does does not do any parity checking, so
             PARITY MAY BE CAUSING IMPROPER CONDITIONAL EXECUTION.  If
             the parity is either odd, even, or always 1, improper
             comparisons may take place.  To avoid this, MAKE SURE
             PARITY IS SET TO ZERO ON THE INPUT DEVICE. 

             3.  STRING IN STRING

                 The third form of the IF command allows a list of
             options to be specified in only one parameter.  The
             following command sequence will compile, link and locate,
             and optionally run a program depending on the parameter
             input. 

                 IF 'C' IN '%1' THEN /* Compile it first */ 
                     PLM80 %0.PLM 
                     IF NOT ' 0 PROGRAM ERROR' IN %0.LST THEN 
                         EXIT; /* Skip the rest of the commands */ 
                     ENDIF; 
                 ENDIF; 
                 IF 'L' IN '%1' THEN /* Link and locate the object */ 
                     LINK %0.OBJ,SYSTEM.LIB,PLM80.LIB TO %0.LNK 
                     LOCATE %0.LNK PURGE 
                 ENDIF; 
                 IF 'G' IN '%1' THEN /* Go run it */ 
                     %0 
                 ENDIF;

                 SUBMITting the above command file with the parameters 
             (:F3:FOO, CLG) will cause the program :F3:FOO.PLM to be
             compiled,  linked and located, and executed.  However, the
             parameters (:F3:FOO, CL)  will not run the final program.
             (:F3:FOO, C) will only compile it. 

             4.  STRING IN FILE

                 The fourth form of the IF command is used to test the
             presence of a particular string in a file.  The typical use
             is to detect compilation errors, "unresolved externals" in
             a Link, etc.  Note that when doing this, be careful to put
             a blank before the '0', otherwise you will think there are
             no errors when there may be 10 or 20 errors detected.  
             It also works if the NOLIST option is used to cut down on
             the size of the listing file. 

                 This form is slightly different from the second form
             (explained above) when used for interactive control. 
             Although the test for the presence of a string will work if
             the input file is a disk file, it will take forever if
             input is coming from an interactive terminal.  That's
             because the IN form of the command will try to fill the
             buffer completely before starting the scan, the buffer is
             about 50K bytes.  The second form, on the other hand, only
             reads in as many bytes as the length of the string, 
             allowing interactive input. 

             5.  FILE COMPARISON

                 The fifth form of the IF command is to compare two
             files.  The comparison is a byte by byte comparison.  If
             the two file names are exactly the same, then the files are
             considered the same, even if they don't exist.  However, if
             the file names are not the same, then the files are
             considered the same only if their contents are exactly the
             same.  It is possible to use 'NOT' as the first
             file name. 

             6.  FILE EXISTENCE

                 The final form of the IF command is used to test the
             existence of a particular file.  Sometimes it is useful to
             make sure that all the files are available before starting
             a long complicated job.  Also, the existence or absence of
             files can be used as "boolean variables" vis-a-vis the "IF"
             family.  With this form, since the 'NOT' may actually be a
             file name, be very careful with the trailing comments; if
             the word 'NOT' is there, then either follow it with a file
             name before the comments, or else make sure that 'NOT' is
             the last item on the command line.


             STRINGS

                 Strings are character sequences enclosed in single or
             double quote characters.  Non-printable charaters are
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 21


             allowed.  If a string is enclosed in single quotes, then
             the single quote character cannot appear in the string. 
             Double-quoted strings cannot contain a double- quote
             character.  Unfortunately, because the :CI: file is line
             edited, several characters are not permitted in the string -
             -CR, LF, ESC, rubout, CNTL-X, or CNTL-Z.  The strings are
             always converted to upper-case first, so looking for a
             lower-case string in a file will not work.  Also since the
             '&' is used to denote line continuation, it cannot appear
             in the string either.  Continuation lines work like this:
             the first '&' encountered on a line signals continuation,
             the rest of the line is discarded and the '&' is replaced
             with a space.  Therefore it is possible to have a string of
             arbitrary length, so long as it is all upper case and does
             not contain CR/LF. 

                 Null strings are allowed.  In the string comparison,
             null strings are handled like any other string.  In the IN
             conditions, if the first string is a null string, then the
             condition is automatically true, no matter what the right
             operand (either another string or a file) is.  If the right
             operand of the IN is a null string, then the condition is
             also true by default. 

                 The IF command evaluates the condition specified.  The
             NOT reverses this condition.  If the condition is true,
             then the sequence of commands following the IF command are
             executed.  If the condition is false, then it will skip the
             following commands until either an ELSE command or an ENDIF
             command is encountered.  Because of this skipping action,
             if an ELSE command or an ENDIF command is not found, then
             it is possible to read past the end of the command file and
             cause an ISIS error 29.  The commands that are skipped are
             printed (by ISIS, because :CI: automatically echoes to
             :CO:), but they will be prefixed with an '#' instead of the
             normal CLI prompt.  Imbedded CNTL-E's will cause a break,
             even if they are in commands that won't be executed.

                 The ELSE command is a part of the IF command, the
             syntax of the ELSE command is: 

                                  ELSE [IF command] 

                 The ELSE command can have an optional IF clause on the
             same  line.  If the initial IF command evaluates to false,
             then it will  skip forward looking for the ELSE part.  If
             an ELSE IF command is  encountered while skipping, then the
             second IF condition is  evaluated, end interpreted the same
             as the original IF.  This is  used to eliminate nesting IF
             command structures too deeply, it is  also quicker because
             the IF program does not need to be reloaded.    

                 If the ELSE command is encountered while executing the
             commands  in the true part of the initial IF command (or
             the true part of  an ELSE IF command), then it will skip
             all other commands until  an ENDIF command (explained
             below) is encountered.  As with the  IF command, all the
             commands that are skipped will be prefixed  with '#'
             instead of the normal CLI prompt.

                 The ENDIF command is also a part of the IF command.  It
             only serves to designate the end of an IF statement.  The
             ENDIF command is required for the semantic integrity of the
             IF and ELSE commands.  However, when loaded and executed,
             it immediately exits.

                 The GOTO command is used to transfer control to any
             arbitrary point in a command file.  The syntax of the GOTO
             command is: 

                                 GOTO   <label> 

                 The <label> has the form of a valid file name except
             that no ':'  is allowed; i.e., 6 alphanumeric characters
             followed by a period  followed by 3 alphanumeric characters
             followed by a delimiter  character.  

                             
                 The GOTO command will "rewind" the current command
             file, then read each line, looking for a label
             declaration that matches the label specified on the GOTO
             command.  A label declaration is a comment line starting
             with TWO CONSECUTIVE SEMI-COLONS, then followed by the
             <label>.  When the label declaration is found, command
             execution will continue with the following command line. 
             As with the IF command, care must be taken that the label
             is declared, otherwise the command file will be exhausted
             and the user will get an ISIS error 29.  All lines that are
             skipped will be prefixed with '#' instead of the normal CLI
             prompt. 

                 Note that the GOTO command always rewinds the file
             first, then  start skipping.  Therefore your :CO: file may
             have a long list of  commands if you are many lines into a
             command file then do a  forward GOTO.  Since GOTO commands
             are not very efficient and  command files containing them
             are not very readable, you should  use the IF, RETURN,
             LOOP, and EXIT commands whenever possible to  avoid using
             the GOTO command. 

             Example: 
       
                  ;do some initial commands 
                  ;; LOOP.1: 
                  IF '0' = :VI: THEN 
                      EXIT; /* Abort it all. */ 
                  ENDIF; 
                  ;do some stuff. 
                  ;do some more stuff. 
                  GOTO LOOP.1;

                 The RETURN command is used to return control to the
             command file which submitted the current command file.  It
             does this by skipping all the remaining commands until the
             last one in the current command file.  Then the last
             command is executed.  All commands that are skipped will be
             prefixed with '#' instead of the normal CLI prompt.  The
             RETURN command does not take any parameters.

                 The EXIT command is used to abort the rest of the
             command  sequence in the command file.  It resets both the
             :CI: and :CO: files to the cold start console.  It can be
             used when nested several levels deep in submits.  The EXIT
             command does not take any parameters.

             SUMMARY

                 Loop is a program which allows the user a measure of
             control over submit file execution.

                 When loop is invoked in a submit file, it forces
             command execution to begin at the beginning of the file.


             EXAMPLE

                 There is a need to search through a stack of diskettes
             for the program "foo".  The following submit file is used:

                                              
                                   WAIT; put disk in drive 4
                                   DIR 4I FOR FOO*.*
                                   LOOP


                 After each invocation of Wait, a new diskette is
             inserted in drive 4, and carriage-return is hit to re-
             execute the submit file.  This is much faster and easier
             than retyping the directory command for each diskette to be
             searched.

             SUMMARY

                 This program allows the user to (re)start execution of
             a Command Sequence (CS) file at any line within it.


             SAMPLE INVOCATION

                 RESCAN :F3:TEST.CS


             ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 The action performed by this program is to read
             and display the Command Sequence file, line-by-line;
             and after each line is displayed, read a character
             from the keyboard to determine whether to: exit, begin
             Command Sequence file execution, or return to
             interactive mode.

                 The command characters and actions associated with
             them are:


                 ESCAPE --the submit file is restarted at the
                          currently displayed line

                 CONTROL$C --Rescan returns the system to
                             interactive mode and exits

                 TILDA --ignored

                 ANYTHING ELSE --the next line of the file will be
                                 printed



             CAVEAT

                 Due to the way ISIS handles the console device,
             reaching the end of the file will cause an ISIS error
             29 with a subsequent reboot.

             SUMMARY

                 WAIT allows one a modicum of interactive control over
             the execution of one's submit files.


             SAMPLE INVOCATION

                      WAIT insert diskette source.all in drive 5


             INTENDED USE ENVIRONMENT

                 The Wait program is intended to be used in a submit
             file any time pauses are needed.


             ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 When invoked within a submit file, Wait will display
             its command tail to the cold-boot console, if different
             from the current console, and wait for input from the
             user.  The user will type a carriage-return to continue
             execution, or a CNTL-C to exit.  Any other character will
             cause the bell to ring.


             TYPICAL USE ENVIRONMENT

                 Wait is useful in conjunction with LOOP and the IF 
             family of programs.

                 Another possible use of wait is within a submit file
             which requires that a number of different diskettes be
             placed in the same drive, at different times.  Wait may be
             used to halt the submit file execution until the user has
             placed the necessary diskette in the drive, and hit a <CR>.
             The user can be prompted by a comment placed in Wait's
             command tail.

             SUMMARY

                 The Note program keeps the user informed as to the
             progress of an executing submit file, when the consol
             output (:co:) has been re-directed to a disk file.


             SAMPLE INVOCATION

                 NOTE     ... beginning compilation of prog.src ...



             ACTIONS PERFORMED
                  
                 Note prints its command tail to the "cold-boot-
             console"; which is video-output (:vo:) in the case of a
             CRT, or teletype-output (:to:) for a teletype.  The mapping
             of :co: to the disk file is not affected.

                 If :co: has not been re-directed, then note does no
             printing, but merely exits.

                 Notice that Note has ampersand continuation, so the
             message may be spread over many lines.

             SUMMARY
                                           
                 Compar compares two text files and displays the
             differences between them.

                 Compar may be used to compare source files which
             contain substantial differences. It is fast enough that
             finding a single character mismatch is feasible. 
                  


             SAMPLE INVOCATION

                 Compar :f1:good.fil to :f1:bad.fil & 
                 print(:f1:output.cmp) sync(3)

                 In this example, the two files are compared, and the
             portions which miscompare are displayed in file
             ":f1:output.cmp".  "Sync(3)" means that 3 lines must match
             before Compar deems that the files have been
             resynchronized.



             ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 Compar prints out the mismatching blocks of lines.



             PERFORMANCE

                 Approximately 10 seconds of processing time are
             required to synchronize with sync(50) and 200 lines
             inserted into one file.  200 lines with the default sync(3)
             takes 4 seconds.




                                     OUTPUT FORMAT


             LINE IDENTIFICATION

                 Each line is printed with a file designation number (1
             or 2) and a line number prefix. The pound- sign (#) in the




             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 30


             prefix indicates the line is the first in a mismatched
             block. The equals_sign (=) prefix indicates the line is the
             first matching line following the mismatched block. 



             FIRST MISMATCHING CHARACTER

                 The first mismatching character in any given block is
             indicated by an up-arrow (^) which appears beneath it.  

                 If the original line wraps around the screen, so will
             the up-arrow line.  In this case, the up-arrow will appear
             2 lines below the corresponding character.



             TABS AND UNPRINTABLE CHARACTERS

                 In the output, tabs echo as single spaces.  Other
             unprintables (including form feeds) echo as a question
             mark.

             PRINT CONTROL
             
                 If the print control is present in the command line,
             then output is directed to the specified file.  If the
             printfile is not :co:, then the output will contain the
             invocation information.


             SYNCHRONIZATION (SYNC) CONTROL

                 The sync control specifies the number of lines that
             must match before Compar deems that the files have
             synchronized.  The default synchronization value is 3.

                 A sync(1) may be used to compare files which are
             expected to be identical. A larger value for the sync
             parameter should be used when differences are expected in
             the files. 



             AMPERSAND COMMAND LINE CONTINUATION

                 An ampersand can be used to continue the command line. 
             It may not be within a filename or command word.






                          COMPAR LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS


             INPUT FILES MUST BE TEXT FILES

                 The files to be compared must be text files.  Lines
             longer than 254 characters will cause Compar to hang. A
             line is defined as a sequence of characters terminated by a
             line feed.


             SPACE CONSTRAINTS

                 If the files mismatch, and synchronization does not
             occur in 254 lines or before the buffers are used up, then
             the message "not enough space to synchronize" is given, and
             Compar exits.


             NAKED-LINE FEEDS IN OUTPUT FILE

                 Where blank lines follows a blank line in the output
             file; Compar will use naked line-feeds (sans preceeding

             SUMMARY

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                 The Consol program uses the ISIS-II system call of the
             same name to assign the "logical devices" :ci: and :co: to
             physical devices.

             SOME APPLICATIONS

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
             *  Execute a long job from a submit file and save the
                consol output, which would have gone to the screen, in
                a disk file, to be subsequently examined and
                processed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
             *  Use Consol to assign :ci: to an already existing
                Command Sequence file.  This is faster than using the
                submit program, which produces a new Command Sequence
                file from a command Sequence Definition File, each
                time it is invoked. If Consol is used in this manner,

                there should be another consol command at the end of
                the file (consol :vi:,:vo:), to avoid an ISIS error
                29.

             SUMMARY

                 The DCOPY program copies entire diskettes to entire
             diskettes.  The copying is done track-by-track, bypassing
             the ISIS-II file structure. For a medium-full to full disk,
             this results in much higher speed, for the entire job, than
             using the Copy cusp.

                 DCOPY has optional formatting and/or verify capability.

                 DCOPY will NOT work with hard disks.  To copy hard
             disks, use HDCOPY.

                 Since DCOPY creates an exact copy of a disk, with all
             disk data and pointer blocks the same as on the source
             disk, if the file system integrity on a disk has been
             damaged, a duplicate disk created with DCOPY will contain
             the same errors.


             SAMPLE INVOCATIONS WITH EXPLANATIONS

                 DCOPY F=4 T=5

                 copy the diskette in drive 4 to the diskette in
                 drive 5.


                 DCOPY I F=5 T=6,7

                 copy the diskette in drive 5 to the diskettes in
                 drives 6 and 7, first initializing (formatting) them.


                 DCOPY IV F=0 T=1,2,3

                 copy the diskette in drive 0 to the diskettes in
                 drives 1,2, and 3, with verification, first
                 initializing (formatting) them.





             WORKS ON SINGLE AND DOUBLE DENSITY

                 The DCOPY program operates on both single and double
             density diskettes and is not influenced by the drive from
             which it was loaded.

                                 SEMANTIC DESCRIPTIONS


             NULL COMMAND

                 If the command tail is null, DCOPY followed by
             <CR><LF>, the defaults set is: COPY track 0 thru 76 from
             drive 0 to drive 1.


             CHANGING THE INTERLEAVE WHILE COPYING

                 If the item interleave is absent from the command tail,
             the interleave from the source diskette will be duplicated
             on the destination diskette. If the item "interleave" (I=)
             is in the command tail, the integers following the equal
             sign will be the new interleave numbers, 1 per track, for
             the destination diskette.

                 If interleave integers are not given for the entire 77
             tracks, the last interleave integer present will be the
             interleave used for the remaining tracks of the destination
             diskette. A continuation item (&) can only be used after a
             comma and before the integer in the interleave integer
             list, e.g., I=1,1,4,6,& <CRLF>.


             DISKETTE COPY VERIFICATION

                 The item verify (V) in the command tail will copy the
             source diskette to the destination diskette and verify all
             tracks copied. Verification means immediately re-reading
             what was just written to confirm that the writing was
             correctly executed.


             VERIFICATION ONLY

                 The item verify only (VO) in the command tail will
             verify the source diskette against the destination diskette
             without copying.


             SOURCE DISKETTE DESIGNATION

                 The item FROM (F=) in the command tail followed by a
             disk drive number designates which drive contains the
             source diskette.


             DESTINATION DISKETTE DESIGNATION

                 The item TO (T=) in the command tail, followed by a
             disk drive number, or a series of up to 4 drive numbers,
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 38


             signifies which drive contains the destination diskettes.

                 The FROM and TO devices must all be either single or
             double density. They may not be mixed.


             LOTRAK

                 An item entered as the first free standing integer
             becomes the low track integer, this is the 1st track acted
             upon by DCOPY.


             HITRAK

                 The next integer separated by a blank after the low
             trak integer becomes the high track integer.  This is the
             last track acted upon by DCOPY. If HITRAK is not entered,
             only a single track specified by low track is acted upon.


             COMMAND LINE CONTINUATION

                 The continuation (&) item in a command tail can be used
             to extend the command tail to another line. The ampersand
             must not appear within an item or its attributes. The
             continuation may only occur between other complete items.
             All characters past the continuation are not processed and
             are considered comments. Exceptions are as above with the
             interleave item. Several lines may be entered each
             separated by ampersands.



                                    DCOPY FUNCTIONS

                 DCOPY is used to duplicate and/or verify single or
             double density diskettes. The interleave, verify and verify
             only option may only be mixed in one way. Any other mix
             will cause a syntax error. The I and V option may be
             entered simultaneously. This default causes the destination
             diskette to be formatted, copied and verified against the
             source diskette.

                 The DCOPY program will type one or both of the words
             COPY and VERIFY, depending on the verify option selected,
             and will then print out the message "LOAD DISKETTES AND
             TYPE 'CR' ". At this point, the human operator places the
             desired diskettes into the source drive and destination
             drives, and hits the carriage return key on the console. To
             exit DCOPY and return to ISIS type the 'E' key to exit.


                 DCOPY prints the following (for example) on the
             console:

                 ---------- -----6789 012
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 39



             where "-" means the track was not operated upon, and
             the digit is the last digit in the (decimal) number of the
             track operated upon. The example would result from copying
             tracks 16-22 inclusive.

                 If tracks are found to be not identical by the compare
             (verify) operation, DCOPY prints diagnostic information and
             enters interactive mode, as described below:


                 First, DCOPY indicates which track and sectors
             miscompare:

                 ----456
                 track 4  0002H SECTOR MISCOMPARES
                 track 4  0003H SECTOR MISCOMPARES
                 track 4  001AH SECTOR MISCOMPARES
                 *
             

                 This indicates that sectors 3,4 & 26 of track 0
             miscompares, and the '*' is the prompt for human input.
             Acceptable input at this point is one of three lines:

                 E
                 C
                 <track-number> <sector-number> <drive-number>


                 where the track-,sector-,and drive numbers may be in
             any valid PL/M number syntax. (Any number not specified is
             taken as zero)

                 'E' causes DCOPY to exit interactive mode and prompts
                     user to insert new disks.

                 'C' causes DCOPY to continue, starting with the next
                      track. The track identification output (as shown
                      above) is repeated , with tracks already operated
                      upon indicated by '- ' instead of by digits.
        
                 6 3 1 (for example), will cause DCOPY to print the data
                      in sector three of track 6 of the diskette in
                      drive 1.
        
                 5 5 (for example) will cause DCOPY to print the data in
                      sector 5 of track 5 of the diskette in drive 0.
        
                 In either case, DCOPY will prompt with another '*', and
             any of the three commands above is again acceptable input.

                 When DCOPY enters interactive mode, and displays a user-
             specified disk block, subsequent display requests will show
             the same block, even if the request is different.

             SUMMARY

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                 DSORT is an ISIS-II program which modifies (re- writes)
             the directory of an ISIS-II floppy or hard disk (i.e., the
             ISIS.DIR file), so that the files on the disk appear in
             alphabetical order in the directory.  


             SAMPLE INVOCATIONS WITH EXPLANATIONS
                  
                      DSORT 1
                      The directory of drive 1 is alphabetically sorted.
                  
                      DSORT 4E
                      The directory of drive 4 is sorted by EXTENSION.
                  
                      DSORT 7 S
                      The directory of drive 7 is sorted by SIZE.
                  
                      DSORT 0 L
                      The directory of drive 0 is sorted by LOCATION.
                  
                  
             PERFORMANCE

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                 DSORT takes about 5 seconds to sort a full floppy
             directory, it is much faster for directories that are
             relatively empty; and it is much faster yet for the hard
             disk.  



             LIMITATIONS OF DSORT

                 If execution of DSORT is interrupted, either by
             pressing interrupt switch 1 or reset, the disk directory
             may be clobbered.

                 Dsort will not work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard Disks.

                      DSORT will function properly for both floppy disks
                  and hard disks.  However, the memory size available
                  must be large enough to hold the entire directory;
                  DSORT verifies that the entire directory is read in
                  before it goes into the sort.  DSORT requires a 32K or
                  larger system. In general, there should be no problems
                  with a 64K system.
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 42



                 DSORT may be incompatible with future releases of Isis.


             ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 DSORT will identify itself by version number. Failure
             to properly identify a disk drive or specifying a non-
             supported drive (e.g., drive 9 while running ISIS V3.4)
             will cause DSORT to exit.

                 If the "E" option is specified, then the entries of the
             specified disk directory are sorted by extension, with a
             name sub-sort within the extension sort.

                 If the "S" option is specified, then the entries of the
             specified disk directory are sorted by file size.  The
             entries of the smallest files appear at the beginning of
             the directory.


                 If the "L" option is specified, then the entries of the
             specified disk directory are sorted into the order in which
             their header blocks appear upon the disk.



             FORMAT ATTRIBUTE

                 Any file with the Format Attribute set is deemed to
             "alphabetically precede" any file without the Format
             Attribute set.  


             DIRECTORY COMPACTION

                 The directory is compacted; so the DIR command and file
             searches may be faster than previously.  Note that even the
             ISIS.* files are sorted.

             SUMMARY

                 ERRS is a program which displays errors in PL/M
             listings. The program displays a screenful at a time,
             pausing for any keyboard input between screens.



             PROGRAM INVOCATION
             
             Invoke ERRS by typing:
                  
                                      ERRS <root>


             where "root" is the name of the listing file.  The file
             must have extension ".LST" which you need not type.  The
             default drive number is 3; you may override this default
             either by the standard :Fn:, or by giving the naked drive
             digit in front of your file name.


             INVOCATION EXAMPLES
                  
                  
                      ERRS FOO           -->  :F3:FOO.LST
                      ERRS FOO.LST       -->  :F3:FOO.LST

                      ERRS :F3:FOO.LST   -->  :F3:FOO.LST
                      ERRS 0FOO          -->  FOO.LST

                      ERRS 3123          -->  :F3:123.LST
                  
                  
                  
             SCREEN CLEAR

                 ERRS issues a "clear screen" for most terminals.  You
             may get a couple of characters of garbage at the top of
             your display, which is the visible part of clear screen
             codes for other terminals.


             PROGRAM LIMITATIONS

                 ERRS occasionally hangs up on very large listings.

             SUMMARY

                 GANEF is an ISIS-II program.  It provides a collection
             of routines to read, examine, modify, and write sectors on
             a disk, bypassing any file structure that may be on the
             disk.  Using GANEF, the user may recover files, destroy
             files, patch files, and achieve other wondrous effects.


             LIMITATIONS

                 Ganef will not work will the NDS-1 Remote Hard Disks.  

                 Recovering bad disks can be a difficult task.  It is
             recommended that the entire contents of a disk with
             "recovered" files be COPYed to a freshly formatted disk,
             to insure the integrity of the file structure, before any
             further use is made of said files.


             INVOCATION

                 To invoke GANEF, enter the command "GANEF".  Any
             command tail is ignored. GANEF will identify itself by
             version number, and prompt for a command.


             OVERVIEW OF COMMANDS

                 GANEF commands are one character, followed sometimes by
             parameters. GANEF's repertoire includes: A, D, E, M, R, S,
             T, W, and <CR>, as described below.  After completing a
             command, GANEF will prompt for another.

                 In the following sections, when the term <block> is
             used, it refers to the location of a specific 128 byte
             sector on a disk.  The format is:


                         <block> ::= <track> <sector> [<disk>]


             where the <track>, <sector> and <disk> are numbers in
             the proper range, or the minus sign ('-').  If the minus is
             entered, then the value of the field is not changed from
             the previous value.  Likewise for any field that is not
             entered, the previous value is used (except for <disk>,
             which is discussed below.) For floppy disks, the <track>
             must be in the range 0 .. 76.  For hard disk, it must be in
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 45


             the range 0 .. 199.  The <sector> must be in the range 1 ..
             26 for single density floppy, 1 .. 52 for double density
             floppy, and 1 .. 144 for hard disk.  The value for <disk>
             must be in the range 0 .. 9.  These values are validated
             using the ISIS-II SPATH procedure.  This is done to
             minimize the chance of entering a wrong value and get an
             error 24.



             DEFAULT COMMAND PARAMETERS

                 GANEF always remembers the <track>, <sector>, and
             <disk> of the last sector it operated on.  Therefore if any
             of the parameters are not entered, then the values from the
             last operation will be used.



             ASSIGNING DEFAULT DISKS

                 It is possible to select a particular disk as the
             default to use when a <disk> parameter is not entered. 
             There are two default disks, a disk to read from, and a
             disk to write to.  These defaults are established with the
             Assign command.  When a command that causes a sector to be
             read is entered without the <disk> parameter, then the
             default "read" disk is selected.  Likewise, when a command
             that causes a sector to be written is entered without the
             <disk> parameter, then the default "write" disk is
             selected.  This is done to facilitate the copying of
             sectors from one disk to another.

                                A [R=<disk>] [W=<disk>]
             
             This command assigns the specified disks as the
             default disks to read and write.

             This command displays the specified sector on the
             console in hex and ASCII format.

                                           E
             
             This command exits the GANEF program.
             
             ------------------------------------------------------------
             
             MARK SECTOR
             
                                      M [<block>]
             
                 This command marks the specified sector.  It is
             possible to recall the block at a leter time.  This is
             particularly useful when following the pointer chains of an
             ISIS-II file.  The header block is "marked", then the data
             sectors are examined, and to find the next data sector,
             just recall the header block again.

             SUBSTITUTION MODE
             
                                      S [<offset>]

                 This command initiates the substitute mode.  In this
             mode, you can modify the contents of the internal buffer by
             entering byte values in hex or strings in ASCII, or hit
             <CR> to leave the byte unchanged. ASCII strings are
             enclosed in single quotes, all characters are translated to
             upper case, and no embedded single quotes are allowed.

                 If the value is not a string (does not begin with a
             single quote), then it is assumed to be a hex number (i.e.,
             it does not have to begin with a digit, and it does not
             have to be followed by the letter 'H'). Hex byte values can
             be optionally followed by a repeat factor. The format of
             the repeat factor is HH*R, where HH is the hex value to be
             entered, and R is the number of times the value is to be
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 47


             repeated, default is 1 if *R is not entered.  R is entered
             in the PL/M number format, i.e., it is assummed to be
             decimal unless followed by the letter 'H'.

                 Many bytes can be changed in a single line.  Also,
             strings and hex values can be intermixed on a line.  If a
             byte is to remain unchanged when changing many bytes on a
             single line, then enter the character '-', this will leave
             the byte unchanged.  GANEF will display the offset of the
             byte to be modified next, and its hex value.  The offset
             value wraps around at 127 back to 0.  To exit the
             substitute mode, end a line with the <ESC> key instead of
             the <CR>, GANEF will re-display the content of the buffer.

             ------------------------------------------------------------
             
             
             TRANSFER FILE
                  
                                T <file name> [<block>]

                 This command transfers the file from a disk that
             probably has a clobbered directory to a new ISIS-II file. 
             The <block> specifies the location of the header block of
             the file being recovered.  

                 Ganef will ascertain the destination device from the
             specified filename, only, ignoring the currently assigned
             values for the "default disks".  If the device designation
             is absent, then drive 0 will be assumed, in conformance
             with the standard convention.

                 It is not recommended to recover a file from a disk and
             put the new file on the same disk, because sectors of the
             old file may get clobbered by the new file.  The last
             sector of the new file will contain 128 bytes, it is the
             user's responsibility to edit and delete the unused bytes.

             ------------------------------------------------------------
             
             
             WRITE SECTOR TO DISK
                  
                                      W [<block>]
                                           
                 This command writes the contents of the internal sector
             buffer to the specied <block>.  If W is followed
             immediately by a <CR>, then <block> is assummed to be the
             same as the <block> that was read, and a verification is
             requested.

                 This command will display the next sector following the
             one previously read.  If the previous sector was the last
             one on a track, then the first sector of the next track is
             displayed.

             and decimal.

             SUMMARY

                 GENPEX allows one to create a large "database" from
             which all kinds of external declarations can be created.
             Genpex will create only those external declarations that
             are needed by a particular file.

                 Given a plm source file, and a template file containing
             all the external declarations that might be needed by that
             source file, Genpex produces a PL/M INCLUDE file containing
             only those declarations that the source file actually
             needs.  This helps the user save symbol table space during
             compilation, and it maintains a level of control over
             external references.  For any given source file, the PEX
             file created gives a list of all external procedures,
             variables, and LITERALLYs.  The template file contains all
             PUBLIC procedures, variables and LITERALLYs for a given
             source file.


             SAMPLE INVOCATION

                 GENPEX <pex_file> TO <src_file>


             SEMANTICS

                 src_file is any PL/M program source file and must
             contain the command

                           $ INCLUDE (<src_file_root>.IPX).


                 pex_file contains text that will define global symbols
             for a PL/M program source file.



             ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 After GENPEX has been run, all symbols used in
             <src_file> that match symbols defined in <pex_file> will
             have a PL/M declaration inserted for those symbols in the
             file <src_file_root>.IPX.  Any previous file with that name
             will be overwritten.  Public symbols include Procedures,
             Variables, and Literallys.

                        HOW TO CREATE A PEXFILE (TEMPLATE FILE)

                 The pexfile contains symbol definition information for
             all possible declarations in a system.  Therefore, the user
             must categorize the public definitions by source file.  A
             pexfile contains file definitions, and then the public
             symbol declarations for that file.  This eliminates having
             both PUBLIC and EXTERNAL declarations for the same symbol
             in the same source file.  A pexfile may also contain
             comments.

             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 51


             COMMENTS

                 A comment line is any line that does not begin with a
             letter or a dollar sign ($).

             FILE DEFINITIONS

                 File definitions in a pexfile have the syntax:

                            '$'  'FILE'  '('  <filename>  ')'

                 For example:

                       $ file (absio.src)
                       $ FILE (FOO.PLM)


             SYMBOL DEFINITIONS:

             1.  LITERALLYs -- A literally declaration takes the form

                               <symbol> <literal_expansion>

                 where the literal_expansion is any string enclosed in
                 single quotes.  It is clear, then that the declaration
                 in a pexfile is the same as in the PL/M source, without
                 the keywords DECLARE and LITERALLY.

             2.  SIMPLE VARIABLES -- A simple variable is is the same as
                 a PL/M variable declaration without the keyword
                 DECLARE, so it takes the form

                                     <symbol>  <type>

                 where <type> is one of the following:

                      A for address
                      B for a byte
                      W for a word
                      I for an integer
                      R for a real
                      @ for a pointer
                      any string in double-quotes

                 a double-quoted string is a user-defined-type, and must
                 be defined in a literally for successful compilation.

             3.  BASED VARIABLES -- A based variable definition takes
                 the form

                               <symbol>  <type>  '..' <base>

                 where <base> is the variable name of the variable that
                 <symbol> is based on.  For example,

                       fieldptr @
                       field    B..fieldptr
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 52




      
                 would expand to 

                       declare FIELDPTR pointer external;
                       declare FIELD BASED FIELD POINTER byte;

                 in a typical Genpex execution.

             4.  ARRAYS -- An array declaration is the same as a simple
                 variable, followed by the letter 'S' (not in quotes).

                       array "token"S 
                       BIGARRAY BS

                 The 'S' stands for "subscripted" and is expanded to a
                 '1' in the actual external declaration.

             5.  STRUCTURES -- Structures in PL/M must be declared as
                 literallys when using GENPEX.  Since literallys may be
                 nested (only once), structures longer than 120
                 characters may be accomplished similar to this example:

                   linked_list 'STRUCTURE (info_part, link_part)'
                   info_part 'name (40) BYTE, phone (9) BYTE, birth WORD'
                   link_part 'last_ptr POINTER, next_ptr POINTER'

                 Incidentally, Genpex will generate external declarations
                 for symbols used in other Genpex declarations (in this
                 case, info_part and link_part), even if they are not used
                 anywhere else in the program.

             6.  PROCEDURES -- Procedures take the form

                          <symbol>  'P' '(' <type>... ')' <type>

                 where the type definition(s) in the parentheses
                 correspond to procedure parameters.  The parenthetical
                 clause may be left out if the procedure has no
                 parameters.  The <type> after the parameter clause is
                 for a typed procedure; it, too, is optional.  As in the
                 case of variables, any user-defined type (double-quoted
                 string) may be used.  Some more examples:

                       sort  P(@@)
                       dq$allocate    P(W@)"token" 
                       OUTBUFFER P("BOOLEAN"@BBBW)

                 In the last example, the expansion in the Include file
                 would be (although on one line):

                       declare (ZZ3,ZZ4,ZZ5) byte, (ZZ6) word,
                       (ZZ2) pointer, ZZ1 BOOLEAN; end;

                 Note --a '1' or a '2' may be used in place of <type> 
                 for PLM80 users.  Genpex will expand this to declare a
                 procedure of type Byte or Address.

                 Genpex will generate dummy parameters and variable
                 declarations of the form  'ZZn' (n is an integer),
                 according to the parenthesized types in the parameter

             SUMMARY

                 The Hdback program was written to simplify the process
             of backing up hard-disk platters to floppy disks.

                 This program will not work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard
             Disks.


             AVOIDS OVER-FILLING DISKETTES

                 The program avoids ERROR 7's (DISK FULL) and ERROR 9's
             (DIRECTORY FULL) if NEWLY FORMATTED NON-SYSTEM disks are
             used as the targets for the copies, or if the DELETE switch
             is used to purge all of the target disk files.


             ALLOWS GROUPING OF FILES BY ATTRIBUTE

                 This program also allows further discrimination of the
             files to be copied by allowing the file selection process
             to include the attributes of the file. It also allows the
             attributes of the source files to be modified AFTER the
             copy is performed. All files with the FORMAT attribute are
             ignored. The default is NODELETE.



             DEFAULT FLOPPY DRIVE

                 The default target device is :F5:.  This may be altered
             by using the "TO" device_list option.

                 
             ============================================================

                 The actions of HDBACK will be described through the
             following


             EXAMPLES:

                                      HDBACK :F0:

                 will copy all files from :F0: to :F5: with the
             appropriate breaks to allow for disk changes.

             ------------------------------------------------------------

             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 55


                                   HDBACK :F0: w1 i0

                 will copy all files on :F0: to :F5: which have the W
             (write protect) attribute set and the I (invisible)
             attribute reset.

             ------------------------------------------------------------

                                HDBACK :F0:*.SRC w0 = 1

                 will copy all of the .SRC files which have the W
             attribute reset to :F5:. After the copy is completed, the
             source file's W attribute will be set.

             ------------------------------------------------------------

                                 HDBACK :F0:*.* to 4,5

                 will copy all of the files on :F0: to :F4: and when
             that drive is full, to :F5:.  The pause to change disks
             will occur after :F5: is filled.

             ------------------------------------------------------------

                            HDBACK :F0:*.PLM w* = 1 to 4567

                 will copy all .PLM files from :F0: to drives 4,5,6 and
             7.  Note that the W attribute is ignored during the copy
             selection because of the use of the wildcard.  After each
             copy, the W attribute of the source file will be set.

             ============================================================


                 Specifying only the device, :F#:, is equivalent to
             typing :F#:*.*

                 When only a single target device is used, (e.g. the
             default :F5:), HDBACK will open a file name TMP.TMP on the
             source drive for write mode.  This is necessary since ISIS
             does not contain a DISMOUNT command.  TMP.TMP will be
             deleted immediately after it is created.

                 If the DELETE switch is used, all files on the target
             disk will be deleted BEFORE the backup.



             SPECIFIES NUMBER OF DISKETTES NEEDED

                 When HDBACK is invoked, it will search the source
             device's directory to determine the number to disks that
             will be needed.  This number is then printed to the
             screen.  HDBACK will then pause to allow the loading of the
             first set of target disks.

                 Typing an <ESC> while HDBACK is waiting, will cause
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 56


             HDBACK to return to ISIS.  Typing <CR> will allow HDBACK to
             continue its copying.  If the DELETE switch is used, all
             files on the target drive will be deleted before the
             copying continues.

                 As HDBACK is copying the files, the filename of the
             current source file is listed on the screen.  This will be
             followed by a series of one or more dots, with each dot
             representing 4096 characters transferred (except the last
             one which is between 1 and 4096, inclusive).  After this,
             if the attributes are to be set or reset, the new attribute
             value will be displayed.

             SUMMARY

                 MERG80 is a program which, given a PLM80 listing and a
             locate map, merges the line numbers and symbol names from
             the map into the listing.

                 With MERG80, it is easier to ascertain where
             breakpoints should be set in a program being debugged.  The
             listing will contain absolute locations for both PL/M
             statements, and symbols.


             SAMPLE INVOCATION

                 MERG80 :F1:PROG.MP2 (PROGMOD) INTO :F1:PROG.LST

                 where PROG.MP2 is the locate map (which must
                       contain "lines" and "symbol" information in single
                       column format);

                       PROGMOD is the module name; and
               
                       PROG.LST is the file containing the program listing.



             INTENDED USE ENVIRONMENT

                 MERG80 was designed for use in program debugging, in
             conjunction with the ISIS-II monitor.


             LIMITATIONS

                 The line and symbol information in the locate map must
             be in a single column.


             MULTI-MODULE PROGRAMS

                 Observe that, when developing multi-module programs,
             the user will invoke MERG80 once for every module in the
             program; there is no way to merge all the listings with
             one command.

             SUMMARY

                 MERG86 is a program which, given a PLM86 or Pasc86
             listing and a link86 or loc86 map with symbol information,
             merges the line numbers and symbol names from the map into
             the listing.

                 With Merg86, it is easier to ascertain where
             breakpoints should be set in a program being debugged.  The
             listing will then contain absolute locations for both PL/M
             statemments, and symbols.



             SAMPLE INVOCATION

                    MERG86 :F1:PROG.MP2 (PROGMOD) INTO :F1:PROG.LST

                 where PROG.MP2 is the locate map (which must contain
             "lines" and "symbol" information in single column format);

                 PROGMOD is the module name; and

                 PROG.LST is the file containing the program listing.


    
             INTENDED USE ENVIRONMENT

                 Merg86 was designed for use in program debugging, in
             conjunction with a monitor or software debugger (e.g.,
             Deb86) which accepts absolute addresses as program
             breakpoints or symbol locations.  Merg86 is particularly
             useful when a given software debugger cannot accept the
             volume of symbol information which may be present in a
             large 8086 load module.


             LIMITATIONS

                 The line and symbol information in the symbol map must
             be in a single column.


             MERGING MULTI-MODULE PROGRAMS

                 Observe that, when developing multi-module programs,
             the user will invoke Merg86 once for every module in the
             program.  There is no way to process all the listings with
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 63

             level source) go right on the lines which they correspond
             to, overwriting the PLM86 block depth numbers, or the
             Pasc86 line numbers.

                 Symbol addresses are presented in an alphabetized table
             appended to the end of the listing.

             SUMMARY

                 This utility accepts an ASCII text file as input, and
             produces a file in which strings of blank characters have
             been compressed into "special" single byte quantities. 
             Programs which deal with these compressed files (such as
             UNPACK) can distinguish these special bytes, because their
             high-order bit is "on", which is not the case with any other
             Ascii character.

                 Another program, called UNPACK, can reverse the process
             and, thereby reconsitute a packed file.

                 This program will not work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard
             Disks.


             USE ENVIRONMENT
                  
                 Pack's purpose is to squeeze compiler program listings,
             and other "blank-intensive" files, down to a minimal form,
             so that as many as possible can be put on a given disk.

             <from_filename> may be any standard ISIS-II
                 pathname and may contain the wildcard characters "*"
                 and "?".  There is no default for from_filename.

             <to_filename> may be any standard ISIS-II
                 pathname, may contain wildcard characters or may be
                 omitted.  If <to_filename> is omitted, the default of
                 :Fn:source_file.PCK is assumed.  Also note that if
                 <to_filename> is a single filename (i.e. no wildcard
                 characters), then the outputs will be concatenated

                 into the single file.

             the DELETE/NODELETE switch is used to determine if
                 the source file is to be deleted after the output file
                 is generated.  The default is DELETE.

                                 **  CAUTION  **

                 Pack opens output files before opening input files, so,
             if one tries to explicitly pack from a non-existent file,
             to a file which already exists, the existing file will be
             destroyed (overwritten with nothing), before it is
             determined that the input file does not exist.

                 This is most likely to occur when one of the tools has
             been invoked with wildcard, and the inverse tool is invoked
             on specific files.

                 This situation can always be avoided by confirming the
             existence of the file to be operated upon, with the
             conditional submit tools, before PACKing or UNPACKing.

             SUMMARY

                 This utility accepts a file produced by the PACK
             utility and expands the special characters into strings of
             ASCII blank characters.

                 Blanks are reconstituted by converting bytes with the
             high bit on into a string of blanks whose length is the
             binary number represented by the lower seven bits of the
             byte.  All other characters are passed through without
             alteration.

                 This program will not work with the NDS-1 Remote Hard
             Disks.

             I.  Introduction
             
                 A.  Purpose

                 Passif was developed to automate the software testing
             process.

                 Such testing involves (among other things) searching
             files for specific strings, or the lack thereof, checking
             whether two files (usually object modules) are identical,
             and checking whether specified files exist.

                 In the past, performing and checking this style of test
             required the use of many different tools and utilities, and
             the examination and processing of huge disk files.

                 Passif obviates this by directly performing the test-
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 69


             checking functions needed, and reporting the results in a
             processed and compact form.


                 B.  Philosophy

                 It is intended that Passif be able to adequately
             process the great majority of test cases encountered in a
             normal test suite.  It is not intended to handle all
             conceivable requirements of this style of software testing.

                 It is assumed that Passif will typically be used to
             quality assure a large test base, run as night job. 
             Passif, therefore, is not a performance crucial program but
             its speed should be adequate for occasional interactive
             use.

                 Under exceptional conditions, Passif will attempt to
             continue processing, if there is reasonable method of doing
             so.

                 The design of Passif emphasizes simplicity and
             maintainability.


                 C.  Execution Environment

                 Passif runs under the Isis-II operating system, on an
             MDS-800 or Series II.



             II. Specification


                 A.  General Method of Operation

                     1.  Overview

                 Passif ascertains what assertion to check by reading
             its command tail.  Passif then performs whatever functions
             are necessary to check the verity of the assertion.

                 The results of the assertion checking are then reported
             in a disk file called ":f1:report.log".  This file has a
             "banner" at the top with three decimal ascii numbers,
             representing tests executed, tests passed, and tests
             failed, respectively.  The numbers are updated by Passif
             during each of its invocations.

                 The report file is always opened in update mode.  If
             the assertion(s) are true, then Passif merely increments
             the "TESTS PASSED" number and the "TESTS EXECUTED" number.

                 If the assertion is false, then the "TESTS EXECUTED"
             and "TESTS FAILED" numbers are incremented, and a "failed
             assertion entry" for the test which failed, is appended to
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 70


             the end of the report file.  A sample of a typical report
             file, and a detailed description of what type of
             information appears in a "failed assertion entry" appears
             below.

                 Each time it is invoked, Passif dumps some test status
             information to the cold boot console.  As soon as it comes
             up, it prints a carriage-return (but no line-feed).  When
             Passif is finished processing, it prints out the new banner
             it has generated, but leaves off the carriage-return line-
             feed at the end.

                 Thus, the user sees a periodically updated display of
             test status information on his console.  He knows when, in
             real time, when Passif is running (cursor at the beginning
             of the line), and when the rest of the test suite is
             running (cursor at the end of the line).  The display of
             this information only costs one line of screen, which is
             painted over and over again, so the user won't lose status
             information which any other of his programs may have dumped
             to the console.

                     2.  Test Failure Reporting

                 When a test fails, Passif appends an entry to the
             report file specifying:

                     a. the name of the console input file
                     b. the ordinal number of the test
                     c. the assertion which caused the failure
         
         
                     3.  Test Result Report File

                 The results of the tests performed by Passif will be
             reported in file ":F1:REPORT.LOG".

                 The use of a "hardwired" output file contributes to the
             parallelism and understandability of testing procedures
             between users of Passif.

                 Other methods of specifying the report file are less
             desirable.  If the report file is specified in a
             "macrofile" which is read by Passif upon each of its
             invocations, a substantial performance penalty is incurred,
             especially with a hard disk system.

                 If the report file is specified in Passif's command
             tail with a control or switch, then the command tail
             becomes cluttered, and loses its "readable-English" flavor.

                 The user may change the report file specification in
             Passif, if absolutely necessary, by editing the load
             module, since the report file is specified therein by the
             string "REPORT_FILE=:F1:REPORT.LOG".  The difficulty of
             changing the report file specification is deliberate.


                      4.  Exceptional Conditions
              
                      a.  Unreadable Report File

                 Since Passif must read the report file banner to
             "orient" itself (ascertain the current ordinal test
             number), an unreadable banner constitutes an exceptional
             condition.

                 In such cases Passif will "re-initialize" the report
             file by inserting a new banner at the beginning of the
             report file.  Whatever was already in the report file will,
             therefore, not be destroyed.

                 The values of "TESTS PASSED", "TESTS FAILED", and
             "TOTAL TESTS EXECUTED" are all "initialized" to zero in the
             new banner.

                      b.  Syntax Error in Command Tail

                 If there is a syntax error in Passif's command tail,
             then a "test failed" entry is made in the report file.  The
             string "syntax error in command tail:" appears in the
             report file, followed by the offending command tail, up to
             the point where the error was detected, followed by a hash-
             mark. This is the standard command-tail error reporting
             mechanism used by most Intel products.



                 B.  Examples of legal commands with explanations

                     1.  File Exists
             
                         Example:
             
                             PASSIF FILE_EXISTS(:F1:T23.MP2)
             
                         Action:
             
                 Passif checks to see whether file ":f1:t23.mp2" exists.
             If the file does not exist, or the file exists, but has
             zero length, then a "failed assertion" response is
             triggered; else, the test passes. A file of zero length is
             considered to be a failure because the existence of such a
             file is almost always an indication of an exceptional
             condition.
             
                     2.  File Absent
             
                         Example:
             
                             PASSIF FILE_ABSENT(:F0:ERRORS)
             
                         Action:
             
                 Passif checks that file ":f0:errors" does not exist.
             Detection of a file of zero length, or greater, triggers a
             "failed assertion" response.
             
                     3.  Files Match
             
                         Example:
             
                     PASSIF FILES_MATCH(:F1:T31A.OBJ,:F6:T31A.OUT)
             
                 Passif checks whether the specified files are
             identical.
             
                     4.  String Found
             
                         Example:
             
             PASSIF STRING_FOUND("*** ERROR #217") IN FILE (:F1:P11T01.LST)
             
             ISIS-II SOFTWARE TOOLBOX, V1.0                       page 73


             PASSIF STRING_FOUND &
             ("this is quite a long string which contains a """) &
             IN FILE (:F1:P11T01.LST)
             
                 Passif checks whether the specified string appears in
             the specified file.  Notice that ampersand continuation is
             allowed between tokens, as per usual.
             
                     5.  String Absent
             
                         Example:
             
                  PASSIF STRING_ABSENT("ERROR") IN FILE(:F1:T22A.MP1)
             
                 Passif checks whether the specified string is absent
             from the specified file.
             
             
                 C.  Additional Semantics for Command Tail Specification
             
             
                     1.  Ampersand Continuation
             
                 Ampersand continuation is allowed between any command
             tail tokens; that is, anywhere except embedded within
             string specifications or keywords.
             
             
                     2.  Keyword Abbreviations
             
                 The keywords may be abbreviated as follows:
             
                             FILE_EXISTS             ==>         FE
                             FILE_ABSENT             ==>         FA
                             FILES_MATCH             ==>         FM
                             STRING_FOUND            ==>         SF
                             STRING_ABSENT           ==>         SA
             
             
                     3.  Multiple Commands
             
                 Multiple commands are not allowed in a single
             invocation of Passif.  The only multiple entities (lists)
             allowed in a single command are the two filenames required
             in the "files_match" command.
             
             
                     4.  Null Command Tail
             
                 If the command tail to Passif consists only of blanks
             and tabs then Passif signs on and exits.

             SUMMARY

                 The Sort program allows the user to sort a file of
             ascii text, line-by- line, according to specified fields or
             columns of characters.  Groups of lines, defined by
             "continuation characters", may be sorted as single
             entities.


             SAMPLE USE

                 The user plans to use a file-manipulation program, with
             a limited capacity, on his source files, and wishes to
             determine the size of the largest one.  He therefore sends
             a directory of the disk containing the source files, to a
             disk file, and sorts it.

                 In this example, the user input is in lower-case.  The
             program console output is in upper-case.

             LIMITATIONS

                 The Sort program is limited to "in-memory" sorting,
             only.  A very large input file will cause Sort to abort.

                 Sort will ask for the output file name.
             
             
             
             CONTINUATION CHARACTERS
             
             
                 When sort prompts for the continuation character, a
             carriage return will signify that each line is to be
             sorted.  Any other character (including blank) will cause
             each line that begins with this character to be sorted with
             the last line previous that does not begin with this
             character.

                 If, for example, the continuation character is an
             asterisk, then the group of lines

                              |       line1            |
                              |       *line2           |
                              |       *line3           |
                              |       ...line 4        |
                              |       *line 5          |
                              |                        |
                              +------------------------+
                                           

                 will be treated as two sortable units, the first
             beginning with line1 and the second beginning with ...line
             4.



             SORTING BY FIELDS

                 On the prompt 'field-' the user can respond with a
             carriage return, one number, or two numbers separated by
             blanks and/or a comma.

                 Let the token <crlf> be a carriage-return line-feed
             pair; let 'end' mean that no more prompts are made for
             fields; and let 'cont' mean that prompting will occur for
             another field unless there are already ten fields; then the
             following responses are possible and will produce the
             following results:



             DEFINING THE FIELDS


             1.  field-<crlf> end.

                 if no fields have been defined, then define one field
             with the default values 1 and eol.

             2.  field-n<crlf> cont,

                 with the sort field starting at column n and going to
             the end of line.


             3.  field-n,m<crlf> cont,

                 with the sort field starting at column n and going to
             column m. eol's are ignored.


             4.  field-0<crlf> same as (1).


             5.  field-n,0<crlf> same as (2).




             SINGLE COLUMN SORT FIELD

                 Note that, to use a single column as the sort field,
             the column number must be entered twice; e.g.  field-
             3,3<crlf> will use only column three for this sort field.



             SORT FIELD PRECENDENCE

                 The precedence of the sort fields is the same as their
             order of entry; ie, the first field specified is thhe last
             sort that takes place.

             SUMMARY

                 Stopif stops submit file execution if an error is
             found in the specified program listing.

                 stopif :f1:prog.lst


             TYPICAL USAGE

                 Stopif is usually used in a submit file which generates
             a program.  Stopif saves the link and locate time if there
             were translator program errors.  If the user wishes the
             program generation to continue, despite translator errors,
             then the Passif program is recommended.



             TRANSLATORS SUPPORTED

                 Stopif is designed to run with the assemblers as well
             as the plm compilers.  Additionally, the presence of a page
             break within a module summary should not foul up stopif.

             SUMMARY

                 This program ascertains and displays the version number
             associated with a given Software Toolbox tool.


             SAMPLE INVOCATION

             SAMPLE ACTION PERFORMED

                 Given that the current version of Passif is
             version 1.1, then Which will write:

                    
                           "program version number is V1.1"


             to the console output device.

             ACTIONS PERFORMED

                 WHICH searches the specified load module file for a
             string of ascii bytes of the form:

                             "program_version_number=VX.Y"

                 where X and Y above are ascii decimal digits. If the
             string is found, Which writes

                         "program version number is VX.Y"

                 to the console output device, where the VX.Y
             corresponds to the VX.Y described above.


                 If the string is not found, Which writes

                   "file does not contain a program version number"

                 to the console output device.
