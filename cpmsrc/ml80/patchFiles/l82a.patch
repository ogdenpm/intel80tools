# replace l82.patch with this file to create the later
# distributed version of l82.com (l82a.com in  ref folder)
# note the code was hand patched and cannot be directly generated
# using plm source, however functionally equivalent code can be
# created by applying the following changes to l82.plm

# replace the declarations
# SYMTSIZE LIT '40'
# TOPMEM LIT '3200H'
# with the corresponding lines
# SYMTSIZE LIT '254'
# TOPMEM LIT '6100H'
# also apply the bux fix as TEMP1, TEMP2 are byte values
# and should be address values
# after the comment /* SET ENTRY FOR INDENTIFIER IN SYMBAB */
# replace
#  TEMP2 = RLOC(L2) + 2;    /* ADDRESS OF 1st BYTE OF DATA */
#  TEMP1 = CANEXT - TEMP4;  /* TOTAL LENGTH INITIALIZED */
#  TEMP = CREATESYM(KBYTE, CA, TEMP2, TEMP1, 1);
# with
#  TEMP4 = RLOC(L2) + 2;
#  TEMP3 = CANEXT - TEMP4;
#  TEMP = CREATESYM(KBYTE, CA, TEMP4, TEMP3, 1);
