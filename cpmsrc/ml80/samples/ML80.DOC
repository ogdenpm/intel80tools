M81.COM	is a patched version of 4.14 which fixes an error
in the IF macro.

L82.COM is a heavily patched version of 4.12 which fixes a
bug in generating relocation information for DATA constant
declarations, moves the top of memory (for symbol tables)
to 5D00H from 3200H.  Note that the old value was for 16K
CPM version 1.3.

In CPM version 1.4, max memory in 16K is only 3100H.
This maximum can be changed with DDT by changing the byte at
2301H from 5DH to whatever.  5D00H allows running ML82.COM
under DDT in 32K CPM version 1.4.
The most substantive change patches the symbol table arrays
from 40 entries to 254 entries.  This number limits the maximum
number of names which can be known within any one block.
After running over 40 and patching, I have not yet hit the new
limit with over 800 line programs.
Between this patch and the expansion of memory, the total
number of distinct labels and strings in the program can
probably exceed 700.

semantics, and errors, of M80 and L80.
