- "Enhanced TEX creates tables of contents & indexes"
  "Digital Research News", November 1981, Vol.1, No.1, p.3

(Retyped by Emmanuel ROCHE.)

A faster, more powerful version of Digital Research's text formatting  program 
is  now  available. Called TEX Version 2.1, its major function is  to  prepare 
documents for printout under CP/M.

TEX  2.1  is  an enhanced edition of TEX 2.0. To simplify  the  production  of 
longer  documents,  it  automatically numbers pages,  and  creates  tables  of 
contents  and indexes. TEX 2.1 also allows users to link together up to  three 
files,  chain files, or insert a file in the middle of the text from the  user 
console or from a second source file.

TEX  2.1  processes files produced by the standard CP/M  editor  according  to 
interspersed commands for automatic pagination, margins, headings, paragraphs, 
and right justification.

TEX  2.1 also offers special features for owners of Diablo 1640/1650  printers 
designed for word processing, including proportional spacing, shadow printing, 
backspacing, super- and sub-scripting, and underlining.

TEX  2.1 is compatible with all versions of CP/M and MP/M, and supports  input 
files  prepared for TEX 1.0. It requires a 20K CP/M, MP/M, or  CP/NET  system. 
Indexing capability requires a 48K system.
