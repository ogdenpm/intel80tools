## The c-ports and toolsrc directories have moved

As the number of ports and tools included has increased over the last few months, I felt it better to refactor the repository and have moved c-ports and toolsrc to their own repositories.

The new repositories can be found at  [c-ports](https://github.com/ogdenpm/c-ports) and [tool-src](https://github.com/ogdenpm/tool-src) on my github site. (note the hyperlinks should get you there directly).

Note that prebuilt 32bit windows binaries are still included in this repository under the tools directory.
