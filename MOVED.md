## The c-ports, toolsrc & thamesSrc directories have moved

As the number of ports and tools included has increased over the last few months, I felt it better to refactor the repository and have moved c-ports, toolsrc and thamesSrc to their own repositories.

The new repositories can be found at  [c-ports](https://github.com/ogdenpm/c-ports), [tool-src](https://github.com/ogdenpm/tool-src)  and [thames-src](https://github.com/ogdenpm/thamesSrc) my github site. (note the hyperlinks should get you there directly).

Note that prebuilt 32bit windows binaries for the c-ports and tools are still included in this repository under the tools directory. Whilst 32bit & 64bit versions are provided for thames in the top level directory
